# WebAutomation (Selenium)
Used Selenium WebDriver(in JavaScript) to Automate **HackerRank** (First-->Login to my account (login.js) --> Created Challenges (createChallenges.js)  --> Added Moderator to each challenge (moderatorAdd.js) --> Added Test Cases to each Challenge (addTestCases.js)) .

**Note** : These files require your credentials and questions that are needed when creating a challenge.
